# ts-express-blog
TS/ExpressJS blog, with JWT-auth and other stuff

This will be project for learning and testing of JWT and ExpressJS with TypeScript. And maybe some other things/techs/stacks if I come up or get feedback.

I make this on my spare time, if not daily, at least weekly.

I planned to use PostgreSQL on this, but I decided to switch to MySQL because of small size of the project.

DEVLOG:
-
**Friday 26.10.2018:** I created the main project structure. I also managed to broke the codebase, which I rimraf'd and started building it again from scratch

**Sunday 28.10.2018:** Added the packages for mysql and made the initial connection file.

**Tuesday 30.10.2018:** I set up Apache and phpMyAdmin.

**Tuesday 13.11.2018:** I noticed, I have not touched to this in two weeks. I wish this does not end up to that pile of frozen projects, as it is very common in me :/
