TS/ExpressJS blog, with JWT-auth and other stuff

This will be project for learning and testing of JWT and ExpressJS with TypeScript. And maybe some other things/techs/stacks if I come up or get feedback.

I planned to use PostgreSQL on this, but I decided to switch to MySQL because of small size of the project.
